      <h2>CABBAGES</h2>
      <h5>Cabbage farming,Sept 01, 2018</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src="farmer/product_images/cabbages9.jpg"></div>
      <p>Start cabbage seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last spring frost. See frost dates for your area.
Harden off plants over the course of a week. To prepare soil, till in aged manure or compost.
Transplant outdoors 2 to 3 weeks before the last expected frost date. Choose a cloudy afternoon.
Plant 12 to 24 inches apart in rows, depending on size of head desired. The closer you plant, the smaller the heads.
Mulch thickly to retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.
Practice crop rotation with cabbage year to year to avoid a buildup of soil borne diseases.
Because cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower are closely related, and require similar nutrients, it’s best not to plant them together. They are all heavy feeders, depleting the soil faster of required nutrients; plus, they will attract the same pests and diseases. For cabbage, also avoid proximity to strawberries and tomatoes.
Cabbage can be grown near beans and cucumbers.

      <h2>TOMATOES</h2>
      <h5>Tomato Farming, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px; width:300px;"><img src="farmer/product_images/tomaa.jpg"></div>
      <p>
        1.Sunlight.Tomatoes require a minimum of 8 hours of continuous sunlight each day.
2.Temperature.Tomatoes need 3 to 4 months of warm, clear, fairly dry weather to produce best. Tomatoes need consistent night temperatures between 55°F and 75°F to set fruit.  
3.Continuous and even watering.Keep the soil evenly moist–not too wet and not too dry.Too much water will drown the plant;too little water will stop fruit production. 
4.Continuous feeding.Prepare the tomato-growing bed with well-rotted garden compost and a trowelful of aged manure added to the soil where each plant will grow. 
5.Loose, well-drained soil.But almost any garden soil will grow tomatoes.Sandy loam is best for early tomatoes.Heavy clay loam is ideal for late tomatoes.Amend the soil with aged compost before planting.Tomatoes prefer a soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0, just below neutral in acidity.

6.Protect leaves and roots. Protect the tomato plant from extremes of temperature–cold and hot, strong winds, weeds, pests and diseases.Set 8 to 10 week old tomato seedlings in the garden two weeks after the last frost in spring.If transplanted sooner,tomatoes must be protected from cold temperatures with hot caps or plastic tunnels. </p>

      <h2>CARROTS</h2>
      <h5>Carrot farming,Sept 01, 2018</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src="farmer/product_images/car.jpg"></div>
      <p> Plan to plant seeds outdoors 3 to 5 weeks before the last spring frost date. Find your local frost dates here. 
    Tip: Plant additional seeds every 3 weeks or so for multiple harvests. 
    Plant carrot seeds 3 to 4 inches apart in rows. Rows should be at least a foot apart.
    Carrots are slow to germinate. They may take 3 or more weeks to show any signs of life, so don’t panic if your carrots don’t appear right away!
    Keep the soil moist, not wet, but don’t let it dry out, either.
    Carrots are best grown in full sunlight, but can tolerate a moderate amount of shade.

      <h2>SWEET POTATOES</h2>
      <h5>Sweet Potato farming,Sept 01, 2018</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src="farmer/product_images/sp4.jpg"></div>
    <p>Sweet potatoes are typically grown from slips, which are sprouts that are grown from stored sweet potatoes. You can buy slips from garden centers, nurseries, or local farmers.
You can also create your own slips to plant in the spring. In November (this is when the best of the new harvest will be out), go to your supermarket and look for unblemished and uncracked medium-size sweet potatoes. One sweet potato should yield about 12 plants.
Store sweet potato slips in a well-lit room with a temperature between 65° and 70°F. Keep them there until about 90 days before the last spring frost date. They will then need to be embedded in soil for 90 days and kept continuously warm and moist.
Use a 1-½ gallon pot for every two slips. Remember to poke drainage holes in the bottom of the pot and fill it with 3 inches of mulch, followed by garden or potting soil. Plant the slips in the pot at a 45° angle so that the sprouts will grow above the soil. When the slips are 6 to 12 inches tall, you can plant them outdoors, as long as all danger of frost has passed.
After you have grown your own slips or bought them, till the area of the garden you will be using to a depth of 8 to 10 inches. Create raised mounds 6 to 8 inches tall and about 12 inches wide. Use fertile, well-drained soil.
Plant the slips 12 to 18 inches apart in the bed, after the last spring frost date. Plant the slips deep enough to cover the roots and about ½ inch of the stem. Water the slips with a starter solution (a liquid fertilizer) that is high in phosphorous, then water generously for a few days to make sure that the plants root well.
